# Book Tracker

This is a simple application built as a side project to track the books that I read and read along with friends with some challenges (Like goodreads).

## Why am I building this?

Even if there is a goodreads, why am I building this? Because this way I learn the technology (here I chose to learn NextJS, may be even more along the way).
